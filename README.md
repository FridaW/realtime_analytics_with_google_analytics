# realtime_analytics_with_google_analytics

Google Analytics has three code versions, one is ga.js ("traditional" asynchronous code) in which we have to use _gaq.push,
one is analytics.js in which we need to use ga send, one is gtag.js (2017, new code version) in which we use gtag.


This is a very simple example on how to analyze pageview and video tracking (which users are "playing videos") using ga.js.
