## Bounce Rate:
This is the percentage of users who only visit one page of your website and leave. They do not visit any other pages. Normally, you want this rate to be as low as possible. A good average rate is 40 to 60 percent. If you have content that answers a user’s question and you want that person to only go to one page of your website, then a high bounce rate would be desired. It all depends on the content and if your end goal is to have the user explore your website.
